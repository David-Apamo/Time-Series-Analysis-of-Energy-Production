# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Energy-Production
This repository contains files for time series analysis of global energy production data. The analysis focuses on electricity production from 1985 to 2018. Using techniques Holt Winter's Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA modeling, decomposition, and trend analysis, this project explores patterns in energy consumption and forecasts future trends.
